/**
 * The console utility class includes the basic user console interaction
 * primitives. These primitives allow different types of data to be read from
 * the console. System.in is used as the console.
 * <p>
 * The file is organized as follows. First the console print utilities and then
 * the read utilities. The reading ones are organized in String and Java
 * primitive types. Each primitive has two versions, one where the console type
 * is read without a message and the other where a message is printed and then
 * the read operation is performed.
